## 🚀 About Mudra AI
Mudra AI is an AI-powered Indian Sign Language (ISL) learning app that leverages real-time gesture recognition and AI-driven feedback to provide an interactive and personalized learning experience. It aims to bridge communication gaps by offering gamified quizzes and conversational practice, empowering mute individuals and promoting ISL adoption.

## 🔥 Proposed Solution
We are developing a *React Native Expo* application with efficient API usage and *AI/ML integration*. The app consists of two main channels:

### *1️⃣ LearnEasy*
A structured learning module designed to teach ISL through interactive content.

#### *Features:*
- 📚 *Modules:* A well-defined syllabus for ISL learning with progress tracking.
- 📖 *Dictionary:* Search for any word, and a corresponding video will be displayed using an *in-place video iframe logic* for efficiency.
- 📺 *YouTube API Integration:* We utilize *Google Cloud Platform* for YouTube API generation and *Playlist ID* management.
- 🎯 *Quiz:* Tests user knowledge with a scoring system and result tracking.

### *2️⃣ Communicate*
A real-time communication feature powered by machine learning.

#### *Features:*
- 📷 *Camera-based Sign Detection:* Uses *Holistic Mediapipe* for feature extraction and ISL gesture recognition.
- 🔠 *Real-time Text & Voice Output:* Converts detected signs into text and speech for seamless communication.
